# rule compliance. Reads the tool-call JSON from stdin, appends one JSONL line
# per Agent/Task/Workflow dispatch to $FREELUNCH_OBSERVE_LOG (default
# ~/.claude/freelunch-observe.jsonl), flagging syntactically checkable
# freelunch-NEVER violations:
#   sync_agent_dispatch — Agent/Task called with run_in_background: false
#   non_sonnet_worker   — Agent/Task not on Sonnet (no model: sonnet, and not
#                         subagent_type: freelunch-worker with model unset)
# Default mode is observe-only (always allows). With FREELUNCH_ENFORCE=1 a
# flagged call is DENIED with a corrective reason; the logged row records
# "enforced": true. Denial converts the dispatch, it never loses work: a
# background dispatch + completion notification is semantically equivalent
# to waiting synchronously. Kill switch: FREELUNCH_OFF=1 (no log, no deny).

# Normalize (lowercase, trim whitespace) before matching so common spelling
# variants (`False`, `OFF`, trailing/leading whitespace) resolve the same as
# their canonical form. An unrecognized value is never silently treated as
# "off": it warns on stderr and falls through to normal operation (logging
# continues) — fail-open to logging, never silent suppression.
