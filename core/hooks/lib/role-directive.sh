# Sourceable library: the boilerplate every rulebook's own SessionStart
# `directive.sh` repeated byte-for-byte except for role-token substitution
# (issue-66 survey: preamble, kill-switch case, CLAUDE_ROLE guard, opening
# and closing lines were identical in shape across all 43 copies). A
# rulebook's directive.sh now sources this file and calls
# core_role_directive with its four genuinely role-unique values; every
# unique bit of shell logic below lives in exactly one place.
#
# Usage, from a rulebook's own hooks/directive.sh:
#
#   #!/usr/bin/env bash
#   . "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT_CORE:-$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/../../core" && pwd -P)}/hooks/lib/role-directive.sh"
#   core_role_directive \
#     "YOU DECIDE: ..." \
#     "USE WHEN: ..." \
#     "PRODUCES: ..." \
#     "HAND-OFF: ..."
#
# core_role_directive <you_decide> <use_when> <produces> <hand_off>
#
# Reads CLAUDE_ROLE from the environment (no role -> silent no-op, same as
# core's own directive.sh). Kill switch, per role, via
# <ROLE>_CYCLE_OFF=1 (role name uppercased with `tr`, not bash 4's
# `${var^^}`, to stay inside parse-check.sh's bash-3.2 compatibility
# floor).
