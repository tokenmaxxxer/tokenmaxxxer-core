# issue #282 Part 2 -- the single core PreToolUse registration. All
# remaining PreToolUse gate checks (their .sh files stay on disk as the
# source of truth) run inside one python process: see
# pretooluse_dispatcher.py for the preserved per-gate contract (verdicts,
# refusal text, fail-open, exit-code table). This shim exists only
# because hooks.json commands are bash-invoked; it must never grow logic.
#
# python3 missing -> exit 2: the serial chain contained fail-closed gates
# (board-gate.sh et al: `command -v python3 || exit 2`), so the
# chain-level outcome without python3 was a deny; preserved here.
