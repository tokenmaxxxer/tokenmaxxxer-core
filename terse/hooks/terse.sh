# Design notes (v0.1.0, 2026-07-19): companion to freelunch, not a fork of Caveman.
# Caveman compresses everything the model says; terse compresses only the main
# session's conversational prose. Tool inputs — worker prompts, Workflow scripts,
# frozen contracts — are exempt because freelunch's fan-out correctness depends on
# their precision, and Caveman-style fragment compression there would corrupt the
# contract a worker receives. Safety-critical messages stay in full prose for the
# same reason Caveman exempts them: fragments are misreadable exactly where
# misreading is most expensive.
#
# State: one word in ~/.claude/terse.level (off | lite | full | ultra).
# Missing file means "full". The /terse command writes this file.
# Kill switch: export TERSE_OFF=1 (mirrors FREELUNCH_OFF).

# Off means off: `X_OFF=0` and `X_OFF=false` read as "not off" to a user and to
# most tooling, but any non-empty value used to disable the hook — the kill switch
# silently killed it on exactly the spelling meant to keep it alive.

<terse-directive priority="high">
This directive governs the STYLE of your conversational output only. It never overrides task or orchestration directives (including any freelunch directive); where they conflict, orchestration wins.

${STYLE}

APPLIES TO: your prose replies to the user — status notes between tool calls, findings, summaries, explanations. Answer in the user's language, compressed by these rules.

NEVER COMPRESS (verbatim zones):
- Utterances another directive mandates you to emit: the freelunch STEP 1 width-tally paragraph, and any declaration that a protocol step (e.g. scouting) was skipped and why. These are load-bearing protocol output, not conversational filler — compressing them away is a directive violation, not economy.
- Code, shell commands, file paths, config, and error messages — byte-for-byte.
- Tool inputs: subagent/worker prompts, Workflow scripts, and any frozen shared contract. These are load-bearing specifications, not conversation.
- Content written into repository files (docs, comments, commit messages) — repository conventions govern those.
- Safety-critical text: confirmations before destructive or hard-to-reverse actions, security warnings, and multi-step instructions the user must execute in order. Write these in full prose, then resume compression.

OUTPUT ECONOMY (applies at every level, on top of the level style):
- Never echo back code, diffs, or file content that already appeared in the conversation; reference the location (file:line) instead. Quote at most the single line under discussion.
- Formatting diet: headers, bold, and bullet scaffolding only when structure itself carries information; short answers are plain prose. No emoji, no decorative dividers.
- Do not narrate upcoming tool calls or re-describe completed steps the user already watched; one short status line only when direction changes.
- Do not re-summarize unchanged state; when updating, state only the delta since your last message.

SUBSTANCE RULE: compression removes filler, never information. If a detail changes what the reader does next, it stays. When compressed output would force the user to ask a follow-up question, you compressed the wrong thing.
