# PreToolUse hook: bounds the background hunters.
#
# Three limits, all mechanical, all enforced here rather than asked for in a
# prompt — a runaway agent is exactly the failure a prompt cannot prevent:
#
#   1. single flight — one hunter at a time, per project directory
#   2. session cap  — WARRANT_HUNT_MAX dispatches (default 3), then no more
#   3. no nesting   — a hunter may not dispatch anything at all
#
# Both files this reads are maintained by hunt-state.sh: the lock is dropped
# when a subagent stops, and both are cleared at session start. Nothing here
# writes them a second time, so a leak in either shows up as the guard refusing
# work rather than as the guard going quiet.
#
# The fourth limit, killing a hunter that hangs, is NOT enforceable from a
# shell hook: nothing here can terminate an agent. What this does instead is
# make a stale one visible — the lock carries its start time, and a later
# dispatch reports the age so the session can stop it deliberately.
#
# Kill switch: export WARRANT_OFF=1

# Off means off: `X_OFF=0` and `X_OFF=false` read as "not off" to a user and to
# most tooling, but any non-empty value used to disable the hook — the kill switch
# silently killed it on exactly the spelling meant to keep it alive.
