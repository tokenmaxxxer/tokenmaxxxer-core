# Maintains the two files hunt-guard.sh reads. Without this, the guard's own
# limits are the state nothing maintains: the lock got written and never cleared,
# so the second of the directive's two dispatches was always refused, and the
# count only ever climbed, so WARRANT_HUNT_MAX was a repository-lifetime cap
# wearing the name "session cap".
#
#   release  (SubagentStop)  a subagent finished — drop the lock
#   reset    (SessionStart)  new session — drop the lock and zero the count
#
# `release` is approximate on purpose. SubagentStop does not say WHICH subagent
# stopped, so an unrelated worker finishing can drop a live hunter's lock. That
# degrades single-flight from a guarantee to the common case — it never becomes
# unbounded, because the thing that actually bounds cost is the session cap, and
# that is untouched. An exact release would need the agent's identity in the
# stop payload; claiming exactness without it would be the same kind of lie the
# header of hunt-guard.sh used to tell.

# Kill switch: export WARRANT_OFF=1
